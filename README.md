**DiT360** is a framework for high-quality panoramic image generation, leveraging both **perspective** and **panoramic** data in a hybrid training scheme.
It adopts a two-level strategy—**image-level cross-domain guidance** and **token-level hybrid supervision**—to enhance perceptual realism and geometric fidelity.

## 🌟 Features

- **High Perceptual Realism**: It produces panoramic images with high resolution and clear details for lifelike visual quality.
- **Precise Geometric Fidelity**: It correctly models multi-scale distortions in panoramic images with smooth, continuous edges.
- **Versatile Applications**: It enables robust handling of generated assets across multiple tasks, seamlessly supporting both inpainting and outpainting.

## 🔨 Installation

Clone the repo first:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360.git
cd DiT360
```

(Optional) Create a fresh conda env:

```Bash
conda create -n dit360 python=3.12
conda activate dit360
```

Install necessary packages (torch > 2):

```Bash
# pytorch (select correct CUDA version, we test our code on torch==2.6.0 and torchvision==0.21.0)
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0

# other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖼️ Dataset

We have uploaded the dataset to **Hugging Face**. For more details, please visit [Insta360-Research/Matterport3D_polished](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Insta360-Research/Matterport3D_polished).

For a quick start, you can try:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("Insta360-Research/Matterport3D_polished")

# check the data
print(ds["train"][0])
```
If you encounter any issues, please refer to the official Hugging Face documentation.

## 📒 Inference

```Bash
python inference.py
```
